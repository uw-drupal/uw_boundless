  <h1 id="support" class="page-header">Browser and device support</h1>
  <p class="lead">Bootstrap is built to work best in the latest desktop and mobile browsers, meaning older browsers might display differently styled, though fully functional, renderings of certain components.</p>

  <h2 id="support-browsers">Supported browsers</h2>
  <p>Specifically, we support the <strong>latest versions</strong> of the following browsers and platforms.</p>

  <p>Alternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or Gecko, whether directly or via the platform's web view API, are not explicitly supported. However, Bootstrap should (in most cases) display and function correctly in these browsers as well. More specific support information is provided below.</p>

  <h3 id="mobile-devices">Mobile devices</h3>
  <p>Generally speaking, Bootstrap supports the latest versions of each major platform's default browsers. Note that proxy browsers (such as Opera Mini, Opera Mobile's Turbo mode, UC Browser Mini, Amazon Silk) are not supported.</p>

  <p>On Windows, <strong>we no longer support Internet Explorer 8-11 since entreprise7pro/bootstrap release 3.4.2</strong>.</p>

  <p>For Firefox, in addition to the latest normal stable release, we also support the latest <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/">Extended Support Release (ESR)</a> version of Firefox.</p>

  <p>Officially, Bootstrap should look and behave correctly in Chromium and Chrome for Linux, Firefox for Linux, and Microsoft Edge.</p>

  <p>As a heads up, we include this in all of Bootstrap's documentation and examples as a demonstration.</p>

  <h2 id="support-safari-percentages">Safari percent rounding</h2>
  <p>The rendering engine of versions of Safari prior to v7.1 for OS X and Safari for iOS v8.0 had some trouble with the number of decimal places used in our <code>.col-*-1</code> grid classes. So if you had 12 individual grid columns, you'd notice that they came up short compared to other rows of columns. Besides upgrading Safari/iOS, you have some options for workarounds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add <code>.pull-right</code> to your last grid column to get the hard-right alignment</li>
    <li>Tweak your percentages manually to get the perfect rounding for Safari (more difficult than the first option)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="support-fixed-position-keyboards">Modals, navbars, and virtual keyboards</h2>
  <h3>Overflow and scrolling</h3>
  <p>Support for <code>overflow: hidden</code> on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element is quite limited in iOS and Android. To that end, when you scroll past the top or bottom of a modal in either of those devices' browsers, the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> content will begin to scroll. See <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=175502">Chrome bug #175502</a> (fixed in Chrome v40) and <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153852">WebKit bug #153852</a>.</p>
  <h3>iOS text fields and scrolling</h3>
  <p>As of iOS 9.3, while a modal is open, if the initial touch of a scroll gesture is within the boundary of a textual <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> or a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> content underneath the modal will be scrolled instead of the modal itself. See <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=153856">WebKit bug #153856</a>.</p>
  <h3>Virtual keyboards</h3>
  <p>Also, note that if you're using a fixed navbar or using inputs within a modal, iOS has a rendering bug that doesn't update the position of fixed elements when the virtual keyboard is triggered. A few workarounds for this include transforming your elements to <code>position: absolute</code> or invoking a timer on focus to try to correct the positioning manually. This is not handled by Bootstrap, so it is up to you to decide which solution is best for your application.</p>
  <h3>Navbar Dropdowns</h3>
  <p>The <code>.dropdown-backdrop</code> element isn't used on iOS in the nav because of the complexity of z-indexing. Thus, to close dropdowns in navbars, you must directly click the dropdown element (or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/click#Safari_Mobile">any other element which will fire a click event in iOS</a>).</p>

  <h2 id="support-browser-zooming">Browser zooming</h2>
  <p>Page zooming inevitably presents rendering artifacts in some components, both in Bootstrap and the rest of the web. Depending on the issue, we may be able to fix it (search first and then open an issue if need be). However, we tend to ignore these as they often have no direct solution other than hacky workarounds.</p>

  <h2 id="support-sticky-hover-mobile">Sticky <code>:hover</code>/<code>:focus</code> on mobile</h2>
  <p>Even though real hovering isn't possible on most touchscreens, most mobile browsers emulate hovering support and make <code>:hover</code> "sticky". In other words, <code>:hover</code> styles start applying after tapping an element and only stop applying after the user taps some other element. This can cause Bootstrap's <code>:hover</code> states to become undesirably "stuck" on such browsers. Some mobile browsers also make <code>:focus</code> similarly sticky. There is currently no simple workaround for these issues other than removing such styles entirely.</p>

  <h2 id="support-printing">Printing</h2>
  <p>Even in some modern browsers, printing can be quirky.</p>
  <p>In particular, as of Chrome v32 and regardless of margin settings, Chrome uses a viewport width significantly narrower than the physical paper size when resolving media queries while printing a webpage. This can result in Bootstrap's extra-small grid being unexpectedly activated when printing. <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/12078">See issue #12078</a> and <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=273306">Chrome bug #273306</a> for some details. Suggested workarounds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Embrace the extra-small grid and make sure your page looks acceptable under it.</li>
    <li>Customize the values of the <code>@screen-*</code> Less variables so that your printer paper is considered larger than extra-small.</li>
    <li>Add custom media queries to change the grid size breakpoints for print media only.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Also, as of Safari v8.0, fixed-width <code>.container</code>s can cause Safari to use an unusually small font size when printing. See <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/14868">#14868</a> and <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=138192">WebKit bug #138192</a> for more details. One potential workaround for this is adding the following CSS:</p>
{% highlight css %}
@media print {
  .container {
    width: auto;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="support-android-stock-browser">Android stock browser</h2>
  <p>Out of the box, Android 4.1 (and even some newer releases apparently) ship with the Browser app as the default web browser of choice (as opposed to Chrome). Unfortunately, the Browser app has lots of bugs and inconsistencies with CSS in general.</p>
  <h3>Select menus</h3>
  <p>On <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements, the Android stock browser will not display the side controls if there is a <code>border-radius</code> and/or <code>border</code> applied. (See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14744437/html-select-box-not-showing-drop-down-arrow-on-android-version-4-0-when-set-with">this StackOverflow question</a> for details.) Use the snippet of code below to remove the offending CSS and render the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> as an unstyled element on the Android stock browser. The user agent sniffing avoids interference with Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla browsers.</p>
{% highlight html %}
<script>
$(function () {
  var nua = navigator.userAgent
  var isAndroid = (nua.indexOf('Mozilla/5.0') > -1 && nua.indexOf('Android ') > -1 && nua.indexOf('AppleWebKit') > -1 && nua.indexOf('Chrome') === -1)
  if (isAndroid) {
    $('select.form-control').removeClass('form-control').css('width', '100%')
  }
})
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2 id="support-validators">Validators</h2>
  <p>In order to provide the best possible experience to old and buggy browsers, Bootstrap uses <a href="http://browserhacks.com">CSS browser hacks</a> in several places to target special CSS to certain browser versions in order to work around bugs in the browsers themselves. These hacks understandably cause CSS validators to complain that they are invalid. In a couple places, we also use bleeding-edge CSS features that aren't yet fully standardized, but these are used purely for progressive enhancement.</p>
  <p>These validation warnings don't matter in practice since the non-hacky portion of our CSS does fully validate and the hacky portions don't interfere with the proper functioning of the non-hacky portion, hence why we deliberately ignore these particular warnings.</p>
  <p>Our HTML docs likewise have some trivial and inconsequential HTML validation warnings due to our inclusion of a workaround for <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=654072">a certain Firefox bug</a>.</p>
